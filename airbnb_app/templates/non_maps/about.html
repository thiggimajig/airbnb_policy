                    <p class="lead">
                        This web app tool was built as part of a masters thesis project with the <strong>Economics and Statistics Department</strong> at the <strong>University of Florence (Universit√† degli studi di Firenze)</strong>.
                        The primary use case is for <strong>policy makers</strong> researching their options when it comes to regulating short term rentals. It however can be very useful as an educational
                        and advocacy tool for <strong>concerned residents</strong> as well. The <strong>future</strong> hopes for this project is to build out a policy tool for cities and small towns all over the world especially as a <strong>preventative</strong> measure against overtourism. The tool is organized in three main parts based off of three guiding verbs: <strong>Assess, Analyse, Act.</strong> 
                        <dl>
                            <dt>First, on the Assess the Housing Situation Tab:</dt>
                            <dd>You can learn about the current housing situation in Florence which includes census data on population and renters.</dd>
                            <dt>Then, navigate to the Policy Analyser Tab:</dt>
                            <dd>Here you can analyse the current airbnb listings in the city of Florence, with no "proposed" policies applied. </dd>
                            <dd>Then you can click into each of the three proposed policies to see how they would impact the city and its airbnb listings</dd> 
                            <dd> </dd>
                            <dt>Finally, on the Take Action Tab:</dt>
                            <dd>You can get involved, advocate for policies, and connect with a global community of activists.</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <div class="fs-4 fw-normal mb-2">Keep in mind that the maps are interactive and clickable!</div>
                    </p>
