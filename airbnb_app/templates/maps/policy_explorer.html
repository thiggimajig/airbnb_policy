                        This map shows the airbnb listing density per population and residential unit for each census tract. For such a wide-spread phenomena, a city like Florence ought to have data on how many tourists are visiting their city, when they are visiting and where exactly they stay.  While there has been some energy recently to create a robust policy framework for short term rentals (ie. Airbnb and VRBO) in <a href=https://www.ft.com/content/2fe06a7c-cb2a-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0> Florence</a>, like other European cities that deal with overtourism, such as Barcelona, Paris and Dublin, currently the only existing law is that each host must register their overnight guests with the police and pay the appropriate taxes. But the city of Florence currently does not have a <strong>data share agreement</strong> with the Airbnb platform, and therefore has no feasible way to be sure if Airbnb hosts are registering according to the law.
