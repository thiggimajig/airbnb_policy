                        When assessing a city's housing situation it is important to take a look how many people are renting their homes. This group of residents
                        is vulnerable compared to those who own their homes since rent can increase between contracts, and the building could be sold
                        at any time resulting in the <a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/airbnb-lawsuit/san-francisco-sues-landlords-who-evicted-tenants-for-airbnb-idUSL2N0NF1UO20140423>removal of all tenants</a>. These indicators are important when considering the policies needed to protect long term housing stock from being converted into short term rentals
                        (like those listed on Airbnb or VRBO) because in many cities, it is currently more lucrative for landlords, to rent out units on a short-term basis (ie. a weekend or week) rather than to long term renters.
                        While there is nothing inherently wrong with short term renting, it is crucial to remember that long term residential housing units are a limited resource, and in many cities it is very difficult, time consuming and costly 
                        to build new housing units --  either due to beauracracy, labor shortages, or geographic contraints (ie. islands like Manhattan or historically protected cities like Florence). Therefore if a long term unit is converted to short-term vacation rental, this has a direct effect on the supply of long term housing units, and ultimately rent burden and homelessness rates.
